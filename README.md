    * Inbound and Outbound links
        * Links from user sites, social media is good
        * Links from highly credible sites like news agencies much better
    * Don't repeat content (use canonical URLs)
    * Limit outbound links to highly credible sites when appropriate
    * Average time on site/page (good content, aligned with search terms)
1. Don't try to be smarter than Google!
    * They've seen it all
    * Don't use black hat techniques		
1. Black Hat Techniques
    * Keyword stuffing.  (The ideal density is 2 to 4%)
    * Unrelated keywords
    * Invisible text
    * Doorway/gateway pages
    * Bait-and-switch (Page swapping)
    * Duplicated content/mirror sites
1. URLs
    * URL is a fancy name for 'web address'
		* Use keywords for paths (concise!)
    * These are all different from the search engine's perspective
        * http://website.com
        * http://www.website.com
        * http://www.website.com/
        * http://www.website.com?a=b
        * https://website.com
        * https://www.website.com
    * You can use multiple, but tell which is the canonical one!
    * &lt;link rel=”canonical”&gt;
1. Page Rank is mapped to URLs
    * Pages, not websites
    * Avoid changing URLs!
        * If you need to, use permanent redirects (301) from the old URL to the new one.
1. Distributing Local PageRank
    * Put careful thought into the hierarchy of page content
    * Home pages usually have the most page rank
    * Define a small number of hubs (e.g. category pages)		
		* Limit home page links to hubs and content with most important phrases
1. Professional
    * Registered domain name
    * AOSSL - Use HTTPS on all pages - https://letsencrypt.org
    * Website performance
		* Popular social media sites (Google+, Twitter, Facebook, …)
1. Disclosure
    * Use Google Analytics to monitor site usage
    * Use Google/Bing webmaster tools
    * Sitemaps (HTML and XML)
    * Embace locality if appropriate
        * Set location in Google/Bing webmaster tools
        * Include a map on your site (e.g. google maps)
        * Include a map on your site (e.g. google maps)
1. Google like what user's like
    * If users stay on your site for awhile, they probably like it
		* They won't like it if it isn't..
        * Good, appropriate content
        * Fast (User drop off proportional to page speed)
    * Mobile friendly! (responsive design)
1. Important HTML tags
    * &lt;title&gt;...&lt;/title&gt;
    * &lt;meta name="description" content="...." /&gt;
    * &lt;meta name="robots" content="noindex,nofollow" /&gt; (also robots.txt)
    * &lt;link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/..." /&gt;
    * &lt;h1>...&lt;/h1&gt;
    * &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.other.com/"&gt;Other Site&lt;/a&gt;
1. What do (should) SEO consultants do and not do
    * Ensure canonical URLs are set up correctly
    * Ensure key phrases are being used optimally
    * Check for and fix unintentional black hat issues
    * Check site performance and help speed it up
    * Attempt to get credible media exposure and links 
    * Add links from credible directories (e.g. relevant Wikipedia, DMOZ)
    * Don't: add a bunch of links from anywhere (e.g. link farms)
    * Don't: write content, unless it's good!!
1. A bit about domains
    * Get a domain name, ideally with important keywords
    * Don't use non-generic two-letter domains (geotargeted)
		* Don't point extra domains to your site without canonical links
1. WordPress
    * WordPress with a responsive, SEO-friendly theme does most of the technicalities for you
    * You still need to:
        * write good content
        * use key phrases appropriately
        * distribute local PageRank well
    * Use an SEO plugin (I recommend Yoast)
